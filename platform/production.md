# Production
Production refers to the generation and delivery of electricity. 

In solar parks, production means the delivery of the electrical energy that's converted from sunlight using its photovoltaic cells.

For batteries, production means releasing its stored electricity. Batteries discharge electricity when there's a demand for power. 

So, in simple terms, production is the process of generating and delivering electrical energy from an asset.
