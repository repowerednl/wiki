# Consumption
Consumption refers to drawing electricity from the outside.
For batteries, consumption means drawing electricity from another power source, and storing it.
For normal demand loads, consumption means using the eletricity up, to fulfill a goal.
Also production assets will sometimes consume energy. Solar inverters for example, will draw a small amount of electricity during nighttime.

So, in simple terms, consumption is energy going into your asset.
