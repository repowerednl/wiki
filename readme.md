### This makes sure that if someone made changes after your last change, they are incorporated into your local version.

- With GitHub Desktop open ande the Wiki repository selected, choose **Show in Explorer**
You will see some folders.
- Open the **nl** folder. */bst* and likewise for the */platform.*
- For example, lets edit the *annual-savings.md* entry.
- Go to *bst/results/* 
- Then right click *annual-savings.md* and choose **edit with notepad/bewerken met kladblok**
- Every entry starts with meta data encapsulated between 3 dashes *--- META ---*
- This can be ignored. Below the second *---* is where the entry starts.
- Use the syntax for [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- Make the changes and then save the file. 
- Open **Github Desktop**, you should see the changed file and its changes
- If everything is correct, choose **Commit to Main**
- After that choose: **Push Origin** 

Now the changes have been made. If the tooltip is currently in use by an application the change should be visible almost immediately
